## Project Details

Currency converter (or currency exchange) is a mini project coded in Java programming language. This simple application provides a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency (say $) to another currency (say â‚¬).

## Motivation 
- Block chain 
- Digital currency
- E- coin


## Implementation 

***Constructor:*** A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes

***Encapsulation:*** The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

## Pros and Cons:

Pros: Anyone can easily convert currency, because of its simple GUI 
 Cons: Currency rate we gate is not up to date or    current rate, its hard coded not dynamic

 ## Limitation and Future work

Limit: User now only can calculate currency.
Future work: In future, there will be a visualization graph for every currency rate like stock market
